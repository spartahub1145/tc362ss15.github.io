      The tech company that is being covered in the article today is the private company Astroscale.  The company itself is at home across the water in Singapore and has its sights set on not only new defense technologies, but also the vastness of outer space. The company states that the increase of space debris is becoming more and more of a problem, with new more advanced rocket technologies and more private companies taking an interest in space exploration, space debris poses a threat to these companies should they launch more missions in the future.  As a result Astroscale has branched out and offered to provide tech support for other new companies interested in space travel and has created a global alliance with them to provide this kind of support. 
      
      While the kind of technological support and advancement is notable for this company, a lot of what it does can’t be accomplished without the help of important web server assets.  The main website of Astroscale utilizes the server type called Nginx, which many major websites use to run their site processes, some more notable ones being Netflix and InstaGram.  Nginx has the ability to provide websites with high performance web architectures as well as serving as a proxy server.  The server itself features low memory usage as well as he ability to be used at a low cost to websites.  Astroscale uses this website server in parallel with the Javascript library called Modernizr which enables the easy writing of Javascript and CSS, which makes it easier to modify a website as well as providing feature detection for users that visit the Astroscale website.
